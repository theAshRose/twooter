## Description

Here we have a wonderful, wonderful mock social media app. [Here is a link to the video](https://youtu.be/VtnfT39sa04)

Here is a basic program which uses NoSQL. Enjoy the video and peruse the code if you're just trying to learn Mongoose! There is much to learn and see here. Enjoy!

## How to use

There isnt much to use, but there is much quality code to browse! watch the video to learn more!

## the Code!
The best part, the code. We used regex here to determine if there was a valid email:


```
            match: [/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
